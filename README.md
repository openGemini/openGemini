## About openGemini

openGemini is a cloud-native distributed time series database, focusing on the storage and analysis of massive telemetry data.

If you have used openGemini, please let us know and [click submit Usage Information](https://github.com/openGemini/openGemini/issues/62)

![cncf_logo](./images/cncf-logo.png)

openGemini is an sandbox project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF). Please consider joining the CNCF if you are an organization that wants to take an active role in supporting the growth and evolution of the cloud native ecosystem.

## Why openGemini

Compared with other time series database, openGemini has the following advantages:

- #### High Performance

  Store and query data quickly and efficiently with automatic partitioning, LSM-based storage techniques,  and better data process engineering, see [performance reports](https://docs.opengemini.org/guide/introduction/performance.html)

- #### High Scalability

  Adopting MPP architecture, support distributed cluster deployment and can be flexibly expanded as business grows to meet higher load requirements, see [Architecture](https://docs.opengemini.org/guide/introduction/structure.html)

- #### High Cardinality

  A new high cardinality storage engine solves problems such as excessive index memory usage and low read and write performance, see [high cardinality storage engine](https://docs.opengemini.org/guide/features/high_series_cardinality.html)

- #### Data Compression

  Data is stored in column format, and different data types use dedicated data compression algorithms. The data compression ratio is as high as 15:1 or higher, see [Data compression algorithm](https://docs.opengemini.org/guide/kernel/data_compress.html)

- #### Flexible Deployment

  Supports stand-alone and cluster deployment, and supports various forms of deployment such as virtual machines, physical machines, containers, and clouds. Provides one-click container deployment tool ([openGemini-operator](https://github.com/openGemini/openGemini-operator)) and one-click normal installation and deployment tool ([gemix](https://github.com/openGemini/gemix))

- #### Ecosystem compatibility

  Compatible with **InfluxDB** v1.x Line Protocol, Influxql and read/write APIs, also compatible with existing **InfluxDB toolchain**

## Support for Cloud Native Scenarios

- Containerized deployment, refer to [openGemini-operator](https://github.com/openGemini/openGemini-operator)

  <img src="./images/containerized.png" alt="image-20220927210909436" style="width:60%;" />

- openTelemetry backend storage, simplified architecture

  <img src="./images/openTelemetry.png" alt="image-20220927210909436" style="width:60%;" />

- Prometheus backend storage，support remote read/write, and Support PromQL

## Quick Start

For a more detailed introduction, please visit our official website [User Guide](https://docs.opengemini.org/guide/quick_start/get_started.html)

This section mainly contains the following:

- How to compile openGemini source code
- How to run openGemini

### Compiling environment information

[GO](https://golang.org/dl/) version v1.22+

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version v3.7+

#### How to set GO environment variables

Open ~/.profile configuration file and add the following configurations to the end of the file:

```
export GOPATH=/path/to/dir
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export GO111MODULE=on
export GONOSUMDB=*
export GOSUMDB=off
```

### Compiling

1. Clone source codes from Github

```
> cd $GOPATH
> mkdir -p {pkg,bin,src}
> cd src
> git clone https://github.com/openGemini/openGemini.git
```

2. Enter the home directory

```
> cd openGemini
```

3. Compiling

```
> export CGO_LDFLAGS="-Wl,-z,now -Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,noexecstack -fPIE -ftrapv"
> export CGO_CFLAGS="-fstack-protector-strong -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -O2"
> python build.py
```

The compiled binary file is in the build directory

```
> ls build
ts-meta ts-monitor ts-server  ts-sql  ts-store
```

### Configuration

The configuration file is in the conf directory. For more information about the configuration items, please refer to [User Guide --> Reference --> Configuration Files](https://docs.opengemini.org/guide/reference/configurations.html)

### Run openGemini

Standalone operation

```
> cd openGemini
> mkdir -p /tmp/openGemini
> sh scripts/install.sh
```

Refer to cluster deployments in [User Guide](https://docs.opengemini.org/guide/quick_start/get_started.html)

#### Using openGemini

Install ts-cli

```
> go install github.com/openGemini/openGemini-cli/cmd/ts-cli@latest
```

Use the [openGemini-cli](https://github.com/openGemini/openGemini-cli) to connect to openGemini

```shell
> ts-cli --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8086
```

After successful login, the following message will be displayed

```sh
> ts-cli --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8086
openGemini CLI 0.1.0 (rev-revision)
Please use 'quit', 'exit' or 'Ctrl-D' to exit this program
>
```

Create a database

```
> create database sensordb
> use sensordb
```

The openGemini supports three ways for creating a measurement.

- Implicit creation, automatic creation measurement when data is written. By default, partition is based on time.
- explicit creation, without specifying the partition key, as the same as implicit creation.

```
> create measurement sensor
```

- explicit creation, specifying partition keys during table creation, During data storage, the table will be primarily partitioned by time, and then secondarily partitioned according to the specified partition keys.

```shell
> create measurement sensor with shardkey farmID
```

Write data

```
insert sensor,farmID=f1,deviceID=d0 sensorID="s20",value=50.98
```

Query data

```
> select * from sensor
name: sensor
+---------------------+----------+--------+----------+-------+
| time                | deviceID | farmID | sensorID | value |
+---------------------+----------+--------+----------+-------+
| 1657959880895515464 | d0       | f1     | s20      | 50.98 |
